# 🚀 Learning in Public – #90DaysOfDevOps


hii my name is chintamani Mohanta as a 2nd year  Btech  student while i started this course i had my endsemester so im am updating day task in today  
Today I officially started my #90DaysOfDevOps journey to build strong skills in Cloud and DevOps engineering.

My goal for the next 90 days:
✅ Deploy a production-grade application using Docker, CI/CD pipelines, and Kubernetes on Cloud.

Why I am doing this:
- To gain real-world hands-on experience
- To build strong Linux and Cloud fundamentals
- To prepare myself for internships and industry roles
- To stay consistent and disciplined in learning

I believe learning in public keeps me accountable, motivated, and focused.

Excited to learn, build, fail, improve, and grow every day. 💪
