# Day 04 – Linux Practice: Processes and Services
## #90DaysOfDevOps

At the end of **Day 04 of the #90DaysOfDevOps challenge**, I practiced essential Linux commands that are commonly used for process monitoring, service management, and log analysis.  
The focus of this day was hands-on practice with real commands and understanding how these components work together during system troubleshooting.

## Practice Overview

### Process Inspection
- Checked running processes and system load using `ps aux` and `top`
- Observed CPU and memory usage of active processes

### Service Management
- Inspected a systemd-managed service using `systemctl status`
- Reviewed active services using systemd tools

### Log Analysis
- Examined service-specific logs using `journalctl`
- Reviewed recent system logs using `tail`

This exercise helped reinforce how **processes, services, and logs are interconnected** when diagnosing issues on a Linux system.

## Personal Note

As an undergraduate student, maintaining a balance between classes, exams, labs, self-study, and side projects can be challenging.  
Despite this, I am committed to staying consistent and continuing to build strong fundamentals through daily practice.

In addition to this repository, I also maintain **handwritten notes** for my DevOps journey. Writing concepts down helps improve clarity, understanding, and long-term retention.
